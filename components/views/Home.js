    We are happy you're here! We are Pet Match and are dedicated to helping people find the Dog Breed that is most
    suitable for their lives.
    <br>
    <br>We've found that when people make educated decisions on what Dog Breed is best for them,
    they and their pets live happier and healthier lives. We strongly belief that if everyone made well-rounded
    decisions when choosing their next pet, together we can decrease the number of pets that have to go to shelters or
    are euthanized.
    <br>
    <br>Let us help you find your next pet!
